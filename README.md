# firewall-network-security
Developed a firewall in C hooked in Apache and a testing website in PHP.

This project is a team project. 
- Folder WAF_Code is for firewall codes;
- Folder Web_Application_Code is for testing website
- Folder Data is for testing data
- File report.pdf is the project report

My main work is to develop a full functional webpage in PHP, Bootstrap but with fully vulunerablity. Then I help manage the database in Apache and debug the C code of firewall. Finally I have to recover the protection of website by PHP to test the safety with/without firewall.
